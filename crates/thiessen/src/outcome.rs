//! The outcome-model layer: the two questions the kernel asks per sweep,
//! and the scale mode from which every validity rule is derived.
//!
//! The kernel asks an outcome model two questions each sweep: what is the
//! working response the ensembles fit against, and what per-observation
//! weights enter the precisions. A latent-normal model answers the first
//! and leaves the weights uniform; a scale-mixture model does the reverse.
//! An outcome model answers those two questions and nothing else: it never
//! touches the backfitting loop, the structural moves, the scaling or the
//! draw collection.
//!
//! [`Sigma2Mode`] is the single source of truth for the model's Gaussian
//! scale. Whether a variance ensemble may attach, whether a global sigma^2
//! is drawn, and whether the fit stores sigma^2 draws are derived from it,
//! never declared per model: an ensemble needs a sampled scale to attach
//! to, so it is available exactly when the mode is [`Sigma2Mode::Sampled`].
