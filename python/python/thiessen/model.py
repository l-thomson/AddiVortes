    The outcome family and the two ensembles are objects with the names of
    the stored configuration; parameters left unset take the core's
    defaults. The parameters are those of Stone and Gosling (2025), s. 2,
    with the sweep schedule that `fit` runs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    outcome : Outcome, optional
        The outcome family, from `gaussian`, `probit` or one of the
        experimental constructors of `thiessen.families`. `None`, the
        default, takes the family the response selects at `fit`: the
        Gaussian family for a numeric array, the probit family for a
        boolean array or a two-category ``Categorical``, the ordinal
        family for an ordered ``Categorical``, the AFT family for a
        structured survival array and the interval-censored family for a
        two-column array of bounds. A named family is checked against the
        response and a mismatch is an error naming both.
    mean_params : TermParams, optional
        The ensemble describing the average. Default ``TermParams()``,
        whose tessellation count resolves to 200.
    variance_params : TermParams, optional
        The ensemble describing the spread. Default none: the spread is
        constant. A positive tessellation count selects the
        heteroscedastic model and needs the Gaussian family with nu > 2;
        the paper's count is 40.
    burn_in : int, default=200
        Burn-in sweeps discarded.
    draws : int, default=1000
        Posterior draws kept.
    thinning : int, default=1
        Thinning interval; every `thinning`-th sweep after burn-in is
        kept.
    prior_only : bool, default=False
        Switch the likelihood off, so the chain draws from the prior and
        `predict` gives prior predictive draws.

        Parameters

        X : array_like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
            The design. Euclidean columns are min-max scaled over their
            training range; spherical columns are coordinates in radians
            and categorical columns are integer level codes, neither
            scaled.
        y : array_like
            The response, one observation per row of `X`: a numeric array
            of shape (n_samples,); a boolean array or a two-category
            pandas ``Categorical`` of labels, or the numbers 0 and 1 under
            a named probit family; an ordered ``Categorical``, or integer
            codes 0 to K - 1 under a named ordinal family; a structured
            array of a boolean event indicator and a time, the layout of
            ``sksurv.util.Surv.from_arrays``, under the AFT family; or an
            array of shape (n_samples, 2) of lower and upper bounds, an
            infinite bound for one-sided censoring and an equal pair for
            an exact value, under the interval-censored family.
        random_state : int, numpy.random.Generator, numpy.random.RandomState or None
            The seed. `None` draws fresh entropy. The resolved seed is on
            the returned object.
        n_chains : int, default=1
            The number of chains to run. Each chain has its own seed,
            derived from the resolved seed in the core, and the draws of
            the chains are pooled.
        n_threads : int, default=1
            The number of threads. The chains are spread over at most this
            many threads, each chain on one thread with its own generator,
            so the draws do not depend on it; the returned model splits
            the rows of a prediction over the same number.

        -------
