#' Fit an AddiVortes model
#'
#' AddiVortes is Bayesian regression on a sum of Voronoi tessellations
#' (Stone and Gosling, 2025): the mean function is a sum of m tessellations,
#' each with a mean per cell, drawn by the Gibbs sampler of the paper. It
#' stands to BART (Chipman, George and McCulloch, 2010) as a tessellation
#' stands to a tree: a cell is a region of the covariate space rather than a
#' box, so a boundary oblique to the axes costs one cell rather than many
#' splits.
#'
#' A factor covariate becomes d - 1 treatment-contrast indicators, the first
#' level as reference, as `model.matrix` and upstream AddiVortes encode it.
#' Where `control` declares a `metric`, one entry per column, factors are
#' passed as integer level codes instead and each factor column must declare
#' `"categorical"`.
#'
#' The response selects the outcome family where `control` names none: a
#' numeric vector the Gaussian family, a two-level factor the probit family
#' (0 and 1 with the first level as the zero, as `glm` treats one), an
#' ordered factor the ordinal family (the `MASS::polr` convention), a
#' [survival::Surv()] of type `"right"` the AFT family and one of type
#' `"interval2"` the interval-censored family (an `NA` bound is one-sided
#' censoring and an equal pair an exact value). A family named in
#' `control` is checked against the response and never coerced: the
#' probit family also takes the numbers 0 and 1, and every other family
#' takes only the shape that selects it. This is `glm`'s rule, the
#' declared family authoritative and the response validated against it,
#' with "not declared" representable. The families beyond the Gaussian
#' and probit ones need a build with the core's `experimental` feature;
#' see [thiessen_control()].
#'
#' Missing (`NA`) and non-finite values in the covariates or the response
#' are rejected with an error; no row is dropped silently.
#'
#' `stats::update()` works on a fit: the call is stored, so
#' `update(fit, seed = 2)` refits with that argument replaced.
#'
#' With `chains` of two or more, the chains are run together with the seeds
#' the core derives from `seed`, each on one of `threads` threads, their
#' draws are pooled, and the fit carries
#' rank-normalised split R-hat and the bulk and tail effective sample sizes
#' of sigma and of the mean function at up to twenty training rows
#' (`posterior::summarise_draws()`). A fit warns, and `print()` and
#' `summary()` repeat the warning, where R-hat exceeds 1.01 or an effective
#' sample size falls below 400 (Vehtari and others, 2021). A fit of one
#' chain says so instead.
#'
#' @section Progress:
#'
#' Progress over the whole fit is signalled with progressr, so a session
#' reports it after `progressr::handlers()` and nothing is printed by
#' default; `progressr::handlers(global = TRUE)` sets one for a whole
#' session. The schedule raises one progression per sweep, to a maximum of
#' a hundred over the sweeps of every chain, then pooling the draws and the
#' convergence summary, so the report closes when the fit is complete
#' rather than at the last sweep. Pooling predicts at every training row
#' for every kept draw, so it costs about twice what the sweeps cost and
#' carries their weight, and the bar is around a third of the way along
#' when the sweeps end. Each phase names itself in a sticky message, which
#' a terminal handler pushes above the bar rather than overwriting, so the
#' phase that is running is named whatever handler is set. The draws do
#' not depend on whether a handler is set.
#'
#' @section Persistence:
#'
#' A fit is a plain R object holding the sampler state, so [saveRDS()]
#' writes one and a later session reads it and predicts the same values,
#' with no refit. A fit written by a build with the core's `experimental`
#' feature and read by a build without it errors with the condition class
#' `thiessen_requires_feature`, naming the item and the feature, at the
#' first call that needs the state.
#'
#' @section Conditions:
#'
#' Errors raised by this package and by the core carry the condition class
#' `thiessen_error`, and its warnings carry `thiessen_warning`, so either
#' can be handled or silenced by class rather than by message. An error
#' naming the core's `experimental` feature carries
#' `thiessen_requires_feature` before it, so a configuration needing an
#' opt-in build is told apart from an invalid one. The
#' convergence warning fires on any short schedule, so silencing it
#' deliberately is a routine need:
#'
#' ```
#' withCallingHandlers(
#'   fit <- thiessen(x, y, control, chains = 2),
#'   thiessen_warning = function(condition) {
#'     invokeRestart("muffleWarning")
#'   }
#' )
#' ```
#'
#' @param x A numeric matrix of covariates, one row per observation, or a
#'   data frame. A numeric vector is taken as one column.
#' @param formula A two-sided formula. The left side names the response and
#'   the right side the covariates, `.` for every remaining column.
#' @param data A data frame holding the columns the formula names.
#' @param y The response, with one value per row of `x`: a numeric
#'   vector, a two-level factor, an ordered factor, or a
#'   [survival::Surv()] of type `"right"` or `"interval2"`. Under the
#'   probit model a numeric vector must hold 0 and 1.
#' @param control An object of class `"thiessen_control"`, from
#'   [thiessen_control()].
#' @param chains The number of chains to run, a whole number. Each chain
#'   has its own seed, derived from `seed` in the core, and the draws of the
#'   chains are pooled. Two or more chains give the convergence
#'   diagnostics; one chain does not.
#' @param threads The number of threads, a whole number. The chains are
#'   spread over at most this many threads, each chain on one thread with
#'   its own generator, so the draws do not depend on it; `predict()` on
#'   the fit splits the rows over the same number. Default 1.
#' @param seed The seed of the chain. `NULL`, the default, draws one from
#'   R's stream, so [set.seed()] governs; a whole number in `[0, 2^53]`
#'   passes to the core unchanged, so the same value reproduces the same
#'   draws for a given package version and platform.
#' @param ... Passed to the method.
#'
#' @return An object of class `"thiessen"`: a list with the fitted state,
#'   the resolved configuration, the number of chains, the thread count,
#'   the number of kept draws, the
#'   convergence diagnostics where two or more chains ran, the seed used,
#'   the design, the response the in-sample fit is measured against (the
#'   numeric response, the factor codes, or under a censored family the
#'   observed values on the model's scale, the log times under the AFT
#'   family), the fitted values, the residuals against that response, the
#'   hardhat blueprint where one applies, and the call.
