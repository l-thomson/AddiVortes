# Whether the core was built with its experimental feature

The outcome families and options the core crate keeps behind its
`experimental` Cargo feature are absent from a build without it, so a
configuration or a saved fit naming one is rejected with the condition
class `thiessen_requires_feature`. Every released build has the feature
off; a build with it on is installed from source with
`THIESSEN_EXPERIMENTAL=1` in the environment, is outside semantic
versioning, and reads a fit the other build cannot. Report this with
[`core_version()`](https://l-thomson.github.io/thiessen/r/reference/core_version.md)
in a bug report, since a fit rejected for naming a gated option looks
the same either way.

## Usage

``` r
core_experimental()
```

## Value

A logical of length one: whether the core in use was built with the
`experimental` feature.

## Examples

``` r
core_experimental()
#> [1] FALSE
```
