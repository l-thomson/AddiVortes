# The ordinal outcome family

**\[experimental\]**

## Usage

``` r
ordinal_outcome(categories = 2, offset = NULL, cutpoint_sd = 1)
```

## Arguments

- categories:

  Number of ordered categories K, at least 2. Default 2.

- offset:

  The offset c. `NULL`, the default, resolves at fit to Phi^-1 of the
  share of rows above the first category.

- cutpoint_sd:

  Standard deviation of the N(0, cutpoint_sd^2) prior on the log-gaps
  between interior cutpoints. Default 1.

## Value

An object of class `c("thiessen_ordinal", "thiessen_outcome")`.

## Details

The ordered probit model of Albert and Chib (1993), P(y \<= k \| x) =
Phi(gamma\_(k+1) - c - f(x)), for a response holding integer codes 0 to
K - 1. The latent variance is fixed at 1 and the first cutpoint at 0 for
identification, and the interior cutpoints are drawn on the log-gap
scale of Albert and Chib (2001). At K = 2 the model is
[`probit_outcome()`](https://l-thomson.github.io/thiessen/r/reference/probit_outcome.md).

## Experimental

This family is compiled only into a core built with its `experimental`
Cargo feature. The constructor exists in every build, so a script naming
the family is portable, but a fit or a validated configuration is
rejected with the condition class `thiessen_requires_feature` unless the
package was installed from source with `THIESSEN_EXPERIMENTAL=1` in the
environment;
[`core_experimental()`](https://l-thomson.github.io/thiessen/r/reference/core_experimental.md)
reports the setting of the build in use. An experimental family sits
outside semantic versioning: its configuration and the values it draws
may change in any release. The table of experimental items and their
status is
[`docs/experimental.md`](https://github.com/l-thomson/thiessen/blob/dev/docs/experimental.md).
