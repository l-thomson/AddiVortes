# Fit an AddiVortes model

AddiVortes is Bayesian regression on a sum of Voronoi tessellations
(Stone and Gosling, 2025): the mean function is a sum of m
tessellations, each with a mean per cell, drawn by the Gibbs sampler of
the paper. It stands to BART (Chipman, George and McCulloch, 2010) as a
tessellation stands to a tree: a cell is a region of the covariate space
rather than a box, so a boundary oblique to the axes costs one cell
rather than many splits.

## Usage

``` r
thiessen(x, ...)

# Default S3 method
thiessen(
  x,
  y,
  control = thiessen_control(),
  seed = NULL,
  chains = 1,
  threads = 1,
  ...
)

# S3 method for class 'data.frame'
thiessen(
  x,
  y,
  control = thiessen_control(),
  seed = NULL,
  chains = 1,
  threads = 1,
  ...
)

# S3 method for class 'formula'
thiessen(
  formula,
  data,
  control = thiessen_control(),
  seed = NULL,
  chains = 1,
  threads = 1,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A numeric matrix of covariates, one row per observation, or a data
  frame. A numeric vector is taken as one column.

- ...:

  Passed to the method.

- y:

  The response, with one value per row of `x`: a numeric vector, a
  two-level factor, an ordered factor, or a
  [`survival::Surv()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/Surv.html) of
  type `"right"` or `"interval2"`. Under the probit model a numeric
  vector must hold 0 and 1.

- control:

  An object of class `"thiessen_control"`, from
  [`thiessen_control()`](https://l-thomson.github.io/thiessen/r/reference/thiessen_control.md).

- seed:

  The seed of the chain. `NULL`, the default, draws one from R's stream,
  so [`set.seed()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html) governs; a whole
  number in `[0, 2^53]` passes to the core unchanged, so the same value
  reproduces the same draws for a given package version and platform.

- chains:

  The number of chains to run, a whole number. Each chain has its own
  seed, derived from `seed` in the core, and the draws of the chains are
  pooled. Two or more chains give the convergence diagnostics; one chain
  does not.

- threads:

  The number of threads, a whole number. The chains are spread over at
  most this many threads, each chain on one thread with its own
  generator, so the draws do not depend on it;
  [`predict()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.html) on the fit splits
  the rows over the same number. Default 1.

- formula:

  A two-sided formula. The left side names the response and the right
  side the covariates, `.` for every remaining column.

- data:

  A data frame holding the columns the formula names.

## Value

An object of class `"thiessen"`: a list with the fitted state, the
resolved configuration, the number of chains, the thread count, the
number of kept draws, the convergence diagnostics where two or more
chains ran, the seed used, the design, the response the in-sample fit is
measured against (the numeric response, the factor codes, or under a
censored family the observed values on the model's scale, the log times
under the AFT family), the fitted values, the residuals against that
response, the hardhat blueprint where one applies, and the call.

## Details

A factor covariate becomes d - 1 treatment-contrast indicators, the
first level as reference, as `model.matrix` and upstream AddiVortes
encode it. Where `control` declares a `metric`, one entry per column,
factors are passed as integer level codes instead and each factor column
must declare `"categorical"`.

The response selects the outcome family where `control` names none: a
numeric vector the Gaussian family, a two-level factor the probit family
(0 and 1 with the first level as the zero, as `glm` treats one), an
ordered factor the ordinal family (the
[`MASS::polr`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/MASS/man/polr.html) convention), a
[`survival::Surv()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/Surv.html) of type
`"right"` the AFT family and one of type `"interval2"` the
interval-censored family (an `NA` bound is one-sided censoring and an
equal pair an exact value). A family named in `control` is checked
against the response and never coerced: the probit family also takes the
numbers 0 and 1, and every other family takes only the shape that
selects it. This is `glm`'s rule, the declared family authoritative and
the response validated against it, with "not declared" representable.
The families beyond the Gaussian and probit ones need a build with the
core's `experimental` feature; see
[`thiessen_control()`](https://l-thomson.github.io/thiessen/r/reference/thiessen_control.md).

Missing (`NA`) and non-finite values in the covariates or the response
are rejected with an error; no row is dropped silently.

[`stats::update()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/update.html) works on a fit:
the call is stored, so `update(fit, seed = 2)` refits with that argument
replaced.

With `chains` of two or more, the chains are run together with the seeds
the core derives from `seed`, each on one of `threads` threads, their
draws are pooled, and the fit carries rank-normalised split R-hat and
the bulk and tail effective sample sizes of sigma and of the mean
function at up to twenty training rows
([`posterior::summarise_draws()`](https://mc-stan.org/posterior/reference/draws_summary.html)).
A fit warns, and [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) and
[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) repeat the warning,
where R-hat exceeds 1.01 or an effective sample size falls below 400
(Vehtari and others, 2021). A fit of one chain says so instead.

## Progress

Progress over the whole fit is signalled with progressr, so a session
reports it after
[`progressr::handlers()`](https://progressr.futureverse.org/reference/handlers.html)
and nothing is printed by default; `progressr::handlers(global = TRUE)`
sets one for a whole session. The schedule raises one progression per
sweep, to a maximum of a hundred over the sweeps of every chain, then
pooling the draws and the convergence summary, so the report closes when
the fit is complete rather than at the last sweep. Pooling predicts at
every training row for every kept draw, so it costs about twice what the
sweeps cost and carries their weight, and the bar is around a third of
the way along when the sweeps end. Each phase names itself in a sticky
message, which a terminal handler pushes above the bar rather than
overwriting, so the phase that is running is named whatever handler is
set. The draws do not depend on whether a handler is set.

## Persistence

A fit is a plain R object holding the sampler state, so
[`saveRDS()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/readRDS.html) writes one and a
later session reads it and predicts the same values, with no refit. A
fit written by a build with the core's `experimental` feature and read
by a build without it errors with the condition class
`thiessen_requires_feature`, naming the item and the feature, at the
first call that needs the state.

## Conditions

Errors raised by this package and by the core carry the condition class
`thiessen_error`, and its warnings carry `thiessen_warning`, so either
can be handled or silenced by class rather than by message. An error
naming the core's `experimental` feature carries
`thiessen_requires_feature` before it, so a configuration needing an
opt-in build is told apart from an invalid one. The convergence warning
fires on any short schedule, so silencing it deliberately is a routine
need:

    withCallingHandlers(
      fit <- thiessen(x, y, control, chains = 2),
      thiessen_warning = function(condition) {
        invokeRestart("muffleWarning")
      }
    )
